# Honey-Hive
Bees play a fundamental role in the ecosystem, contributing to the pollination of many plants and honey production. The aim of this project is to create a simulation of a beehive using Sibilla and study how certain factors influence bee behaviour and honey production.

### Implementation

The implementation of the model is made by using the tool
[*[Sibilla]*](https://github.com/quasylab/sibilla).

### Documentation

A detailed description of the model is available in [*Honey Hive - Report.pdf*](https://github.com/damiano-cacchiarelli/Honey-Hive/blob/main/Honey%20Hive%20-%20Report.pdf)
